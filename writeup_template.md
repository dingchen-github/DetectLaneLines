# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road**


The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of the following steps.
1. Read in the images into a list.
2. Converte the images to grayscale.
3. Do a Gaussian smoothing / blurring.
4. Do a Canny edge detection.
5. Create a masked edges image to define the area for searching for lanes.
6. Do a Hugh space transformation.
7. Draw the identified lines.
8. Combine the line images with the original images.
9. Write the images to files.

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function with the following thoughts.
1. Separate the lines to left and right ones.
2. Find the longest line segment among the left or right lines.
3. Extrapolate this longest line segment to the top and bottom of the region of interest.

From the output test images I can see, this function works well, for example:
Note: Since I used `cv2.imshow`, the color [255, 0, 0] in drawing_lines is blue.

In the videos, this function delivers also good results, from each frame point of view.

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline

1. The region of interest is predefined in the code. Although I referred to the image shape, not absolute values, but this region would only work for this kind of images and videos. For a certain car model, the lane cameras would deliver the same kind of images and videos, so this code could work, but possibly not for another car model.

2. When I play the videos (solidWhiteRight.mp4, solidYellowLeft.mp4), I can see the lines are not stable as in P1_example.mp4. They jump back and forth within small distances. I am not sure if this will have impact on other autonomous driving functions, which depend on the identified lanes.


### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

1. A possible solution would be to calibrate the region of interest for each car model.

2. A potential improvement could be to use the longest two or three line segments to calculate their average position and slope, instead of only one line segment.
